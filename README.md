  <summary>Introduction to QFN-48 Package, chip, pads, core, die and IPs</summary>

1. QFN-48 Package:
   - QFN stands for "Quad Flat No-Lead."
   - It is a surface-mount integrated circuit (IC) package.
   - The "48" denotes the number of pins or leads on the package.

2. Chip:
   - A chip, also known as an integrated circuit (IC), is a small electronic device containing a complex network of transistors and other components.
   - It serves various functions in electronic devices, such as processing, memory, or signal amplification.

3. Pads:
   - Pads are metal areas on the surface of an IC package used for soldering connections to a circuit board.
   - In a QFN-48 package, there are 48 pads for connecting to the circuit.

4. Core:
   - The core of a microprocessor or microcontroller chip is the central processing unit (CPU) responsible for executing instructions and calculations.
   - It is the "brain" of the chip.

5. Die:
   - The die is the silicon wafer that contains the actual electronic components of an integrated circuit.
   - It is usually very small and houses transistors, resistors, and other elements that make up the chip's functionality.

6. IPs (Intellectual Property):
   - IPs in the context of electronics refer to pre-designed and pre-verified functional blocks or modules that can be integrated into a chip.
   - These can include processor cores, memory blocks, or specialized functions like communication interfaces.
   - Using IPs can speed up chip development and reduce design complexity.

* OpenLane:
   - OpenLane is an open-source software toolchain for designing and customizing digital integrated circuits (ICs) or chips.
   - It automates various steps in the chip design process, making it more accessible and cost-effective for semiconductor engineers and researchers.

* Strive Chipsets:
   - Strive chipsets are a family of semiconductor solutions developed by a specific company or organization.
   - These chipsets are designed with specific goals or applications in mind, such as high-performance computing, AI, or networking, and may include various integrated components optimized for those purposes.
